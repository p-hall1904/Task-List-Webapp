# Task-List-Webapp

This is a webapp task list manager I have developed in collaboration with one of my friends. I built the initial framework and first version, while the second version is a collaborative work in which we implement database features and actually host the website. Implementing the database allows the data to be stored across devices and users and allows for a better expereience as list won't get deleted if a browsers cache is wiped.
